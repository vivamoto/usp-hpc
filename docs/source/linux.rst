Useful Linux Commands
=====================

Manual pages
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``man`` command provides an online reference manual of any command. For example, use this command to see reference of ``ls``::

	$ man ls

Linux processes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``top`` command shows CPU and memory usage, running processes and other information. It provides a dynamic view of the sytem usage, 

 	$ top

Running in background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Connection may drop for several reasons, including computer hibernation. When this occurs, Linux terminates all processes running in the disconnected terminal and you have to run them again. The simplest way to keep the process running is sending to background by adding ``&`` to the command::

	$ sleep 60 & 
	
A message appears when the process ends::

	[1]+  Done                    sleep 60
	
To send a running process to the background, suspend execution with ``<CTRL> + z`` and execute ``bg`` to send to background::


	$ sleep 60
	^Z
	[1]+  Stopped                 sleep 60
	$ bg
	[1]+ sleep 60 &
	
Bring back to foreground with ``fg``.

screen
^^^^^^

The ``screen`` command opens a virtual terminal that keeps running even when the main terminal is disconnected. Another real terminal can connect to it, which makes it useful when installing packages. 

Steps to use ``screen``::

#. Open a virtual terminal with the ``screen`` command.
#. Run any command or script in this terminal.
#. While the command is running, disconnect the terminal with ``<CTRL> + a`` and ``<CTRL> + d``.
#. Run ``screen -ls`` to list all virtual terminals.
#. Reconnect with ``screen -r``.

Common options::

* ``<CTRL> + a c`` Create a new window (with shell)
* ``<CTRL> + a â€œ`` List all window
* ``<CTRL> + a 0`` Switch to window 0 (by number)
* ``<CTRL> + a A`` Rename the current window
* ``<CTRL> + a S`` Split current region horizontally into two regions
* ``<CTRL> + a |`` Split current region vertically into two regions
* ``<CTRL> + a tab`` Switch the input focus to the next region
* ``<CTRL> + a <CTRL> + a`` Toggle between the current and previous region
* ``<CTRL> + a Q``  Close all regions but the current one
* ``<CTRL> + a X`` Close the current region
