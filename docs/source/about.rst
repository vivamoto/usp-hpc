This is the unofficial guide to High-Performance Computing clusters at Universidade de Sao Paulo. I created this document while configuring the environment to train a machine learning model during my master's degree research. It's quick start guide to help new users setup the development environment, schedule jobs and train ML/DL models fast. For detailed information on each topic, I suggest searching the Internet.
